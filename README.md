## Investigate a Dataset
This is the 2nd project of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

### Summary
In this project, I will analyze a "no show appointments" dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.


### Data Set

> **Data Set**: No-show appointments dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) which could be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/downloads/noshowappointments.zip) and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment

* ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
* ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program.
* ‘No-show’ says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
